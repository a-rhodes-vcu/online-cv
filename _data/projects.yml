  title: Project Manager | BNFO 621. Business and Entrepreneurship Essentials for Life Scientists
  link: "#"
  tagline: '<br>Worked within a group of two as project managers tasked with upgrading a laboratory to a Biosafety Level III laboratory in an effort to put a bid for a contract with the Department of Defense (DoD) in order to analyze bioterrorism pathogens. The upgrades include training personnel to meet the standard operating procedures of a BSL III laboratory, the requirements of the DoD, and obtain the necessary equipment. Upon receiving the contract from the DoD the laboratory is not only responsible for analyzing these dangerous pathogens, but also for submitting a formal report of findings to the DoD. Our goal is to evaluate the timeline of the upgrade, the costs of the upgrades, and determine if this is a financially sound investment. The cost of upgrading the lab to be applicable for the contact was determined to be $28,216.83. This total was derived from the summation of the disposable lab coats ($22.99), disposable face shields ($279.99), and biological safety cabinet (BSC) class II ($6,183.09). This also includes the salary of the employees during their training.'
